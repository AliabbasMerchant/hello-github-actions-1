# Welcome

This course helps you create a simple action and use that action in a workflow.

There are parts of this course which will need to be completed locally, using the command line. During those steps, more instructions are provided in case you're used to working with the GitHub.com interface directly.

> Note: This course will only work for members of the GitHub Actions limited public beta.
>
> GitHub Actions is currently in limited public beta and is subject to change. We strongly recommend that you do not use this feature for high-value workflows and content during the beta period. For more information, see "[About GitHub Actions]()."
