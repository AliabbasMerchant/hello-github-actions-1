# Welcome

This course helps you create a simple GitHub Action and use that action in a workflow. 

## What are GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions are a flexible way to automate nearly every aspect of your team's software workflow. Here are just a few of the ways teams are using GitHub Actions:

- Automated testing (CI)
- Continuous delivery and deployment
- Responding to workflow triggers using issues, @ mentions, labels, and more
- Triggering code reviews
- Managing branches
- Triaging issues and pull requests

The sky is truly the limit with GitHub Actions.

The best part, these workflows are stored as code in your repository and easily shared and reused across teams.

To learn even more, check out the [GitHub Actions page](https://github.com/features/actions).

> Note: This course will only work for members of the GitHub Actions beta. Please [sign up for GitHub Actions Beta](https://github.com/features/actions) before continuing this course.

### Before you begin

In this course you will work with issues and pull requests, as well as edit files. If these things are familiar to you, we recommend you take the [Introduction to GitHub]({{ host }}/githubtraining/introduction-to-github) course, first!
