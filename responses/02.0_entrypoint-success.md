Nice work adding the `entrypoint.sh` script. This script will help define the **action**.

In `entrypoint.sh`, all we're doing is outputting a "Hello world" message using an environment variable called `MY_NAME`, which we'll define in the next step.

Next, we'll define a **workflow** that uses the GitHub Action.

### Workflow Files
Workflows are defined in special files in the `.github/workflows` directory, named `workflow.yaml`.

Workflows can execute based on your chosen event. For this lab, we'll be using the [`push`](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pushevent) event.

We'll break down each line of the workflow in the next step. 

## Step 3: Add a workflow file

First, we'll add the bones of the workflow. We'll add the action itself in a later step.

### :keyboard: Activity: Name and trigger your workflow

1. As a part of this branch and pull request, create a `workflows` directory nested inside the `.github` directory.
1. In the new `.github/workflows/` directory, create a file titled `workflow.yaml`
1. Add the following content to the `workflow.yaml` file:
    ```yaml
    name: A workflow for my Hello World file
    on: push
    ```
1. Stage and commit the changes
1. Push the changes to GitHub

The `workflow.yaml` file cannot be edited using an integration. Try editing the file using the web interface, or your command line.

It is possible that you are using an integration (like GitHub Desktop or any other tool that authenticates as you and pushes on your behalf) if you receive a message like the one below:

```shell
To https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 ! [remote rejected] your-branch -> your-branch (refusing to allow an integration to update workflow.yaml)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git'
```
